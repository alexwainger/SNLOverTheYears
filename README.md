# SNLOverTheYears
EDAV Final Project analyzing the way SNL's guests have changed over the years.

To run the scrapers and cleaners, simply clone this repo, navigate to the root directory, and run the command `python python/scraper.py`. This will generate musical guests and hosts files in the data folder. To clean up the two files and add some additional meta-categories to the files, run `python python/cleaner.py` from the root again. This will create two new files, one for musical guests and one for hosts that are clean and ready for analysis!
